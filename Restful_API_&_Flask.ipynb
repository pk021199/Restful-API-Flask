        "1. What is a RESTful API?\n",
        " - A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of web service that follows the principles of REST architecture. It allows communication between computer systems over the internet using standard HTTP methods. RESTful APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and stateless.\n",
        "\n",
        "     **Key Concepts of RESTful APIs:**\n",
        "     1. Resources:\n",
        "      * Everything in REST is considered a resource, such as a user, a post, or a product.\n",
        "      * Resources are identified using URIs (e.g., https://api.example.com/users/123).\n",
        "     2. HTTP Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "      REST uses standard HTTP methods to operate on resources:\n",
        "      * GET – Retrieve a resource.\n",
        "      * POST – Create a new resource.\n",
        "      * PUT – Update/replace an existing resource.\n",
        "      * PATCH – Partially update a resource.\n",
        "      * DELETE – Remove a resource.\n",
        "     3. Statelessness:\n",
        "      * Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process it.\n",
        "      * The server does not store any client context between requests.\n",
        "     4. JSON or XML Payloads:\n",
        "      * RESTful APIs often use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) to exchange data, though XML can also be used.\n",
        "     5. HTTP Status Codes:\n",
        "     * Responses include standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result:\n",
        "      * 200 OK – Success\n",
        "      * 201 Created – Resource created\n",
        "      * 400 Bad Request – Client error\n",
        "      * 401 Unauthorized – Authentication failure\n",
        "      * 404 Not Found – Resource not found\n",
        "      * 500 Internal Server Error – Server-side issue\n",
        "     6. Uniform Interface:\n",
        "      * REST emphasizes a consistent, uniform interface, making it easier to understand and use across different APIs.\n",

        " - An API specification is a detailed, formal document that describes how an API behaves and how developers should use it. It outlines the structure, endpoints, methods, request/response formats, authentication, and error handling of the API.\n",

        "        * Enumerates possible HTTP response codes and their meanings.\n",

        "      7. Authentication Requirements:\n",
        "        * Describes how clients should authenticate (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens).\n",
        "      8. Error Messages:\n",
        "        * Lists possible error messages and codes for different failure scenarios.\n",
        "      9. Rate Limiting and Throttling (if applicable):\n",
        "        * Specifies how often the API can be called (e.g., 1000 requests per hour).\n",
        "\n",
        "     **Common Formats for API Specifications:**\n",
        "        * OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger) – the most widely used standard for RESTful APIs.\n",
        "        * RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) – a YAML-based modeling language.\n",
        "        * API Blueprint – a markdown-based format for describing APIs.\n",
        "        * GraphQL Schema – for GraphQL APIs, it defines the types, queries, and mutations.\n",
        "\n",
        "     **Why API Specifications Matter:**\n",
        "        * Consistency: Ensures all developers understand how the API behaves.\n",
        "        * Automation: Allows for automatic code generation, testing, and documentation.\n",
        "        * Collaboration: Helps frontend and backend teams work in parallel.\n",
        "        * Validation: Makes it easier to test if the API meets its contract.\n",

        " - Securing a Flask API is critical to protect data, users, and server resources from unauthorized access, misuse, or attacks. Flask provides flexibility to implement various security layers depending on your API's requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "     **Key Strategies to Secure a Flask API:**\n",
        "     1. Authentication\n",
        "       \n",
        "       Verify the identity of users or systems making requests.\n",
        "       * Token-based Authentication (e.g., JWT — JSON Web Tokens)\n",
        "       * API Keys\n",
        "       * OAuth2 (for third-party login or delegated access)\n",
        "     2. Authorization\n",
        "       \n",
        "       Control what authenticated users can do.\n",
        "       * Implement role-based access control (RBAC)\n",
        "       * Check permissions in protected routes\n",
        "     3. Input Validation & Sanitization\n",
        "       \n",
        "       Protect against injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\n",
        "       * Use libraries like marshmallow, pydantic, or Flask-WTF\n",
        "       * Always validate and sanitize input from users\n",
        "     4. Use HTTPS\n",
        "       \n",
        "       Encrypt data in transit using SSL/TLS.\n",
        "       * Prevents data sniffing and man-in-the-middle attacks\n",

        "       Prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.\n",

        "       \n",
        "       Avoid exposing internal logic or stack traces.\n",
        "       * Use custom error messages for client-side errors (e.g., 400, 404)\n",
